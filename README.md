# 📘 My-Leetcode-Solutions

Welcome! This repository contains my daily solutions to various [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) problems.  
Most solutions are written in a simple and beginner-friendly way, with a focus on clarity and consistency.

> ⚠️ Note: These solutions are intended mainly for learning and practice. If you're an experienced developer looking for optimized or advanced techniques, this repo might not be for you.

## 📌 Goals

- Practice algorithmic thinking daily
- Improve problem-solving skills over time
- Build a personal reference of common patterns and techniques
- Share solutions with other beginners

---

## 🧠 Structure

The repository is organized by problem difficulty and number. Each folder or file typically includes:

- The problem name
- A short explanation or comments (where helpful)
- A working Python solution (unless otherwise stated)

Example:

<pre>
📁 easy/
│   📁 roman_to_integer/
│   │   ├── README.md

## 🤝 Contributions

While this is mostly a personal learning repo, feel free to open an issue or PR if you notice something worth improving or discussing!

---

## 📅 Daily Progress

I aim to solve at least **one** problem every day. Some days may include multiple solutions or problem variants.

You can follow my progress via commits or the [`progress.log`](./progress.log) file (if available).

## ✅ Disclaimer

These solutions are not guaranteed to be the most efficient or elegant — they reflect my learning process.  
Use them as a reference, not as model answers.
