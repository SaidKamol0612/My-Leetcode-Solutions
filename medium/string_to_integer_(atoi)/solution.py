# Testcase 1

print(res == 42)
# Explanation:

# The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.
# Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
#          ^
# Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
#          ^
# Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)

# Testcase 2
res = solution.myAtoi("   -042")
print(res, end=" ")
print(res == -42)
# Explanation:

# Step 1: "   -042" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
#             ^
# Step 2: "   -042" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
#              ^
# Step 3: "   -042" ("042" is read in, leading zeros ignored in the result)


# Testcase 3
res = solution.myAtoi("1337c0d3")
print(res, end=" ")
print(res == 1337)
# Explanation:

# Step 1: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
#          ^
# Step 2: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
#          ^
# Step 3: "1337c0d3" ("1337" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
#              ^


# Testcase 4
res = solution.myAtoi("0-1")
print(res, end=" ")
print(res == 0)
# Explanation:

# Step 1: "0-1" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
#          ^
# Step 2: "0-1" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
#          ^
# Step 3: "0-1" ("0" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)

# Testcase 4
res = solution.myAtoi("words and 987")
print(res, end=" ")
print(res == 0)
# Explanation:

# Reading stops at the first non-digit character 'w'.
